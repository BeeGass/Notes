<span class="newthought">These notes</span> behave as my one stop shop for all classes I have taken and wish to review. My hope is that this can become somewhat of a database of notes for me (and hopefully others) to review. {% include sidenote.html id="note-pgm" note="I will often use these sidenotes as a way to define terms, clarify ideas further or whatever else that may be applicable." %} Please understand that I am writing these notes as im watching lecture so there may be spelling mistakes, lapses in grammar, profanity or simply incorrect material. I hope to revise these as soon as possible. 

If you wish to learn more about the content that is learned in each class then I would recommend clicking on the links to various classes where you will be redirected to the table of contents for that applicable class. {% include marginnote.html id='mn-construction' note='The notes are still **under construction**! You will probably find several typos. If you do, please let me know, or submit a pull request with your fixes to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/BeeGass/Notes).'%}



## Notes

### Mathematics

1. [Probability](): Notes associated with WPI's probability class, taught by Michael Johnson.
    * [AFCIP](): Notes associated with my readings and questions answered from the textbook [A First Course in Probability](http://julio.staff.ipb.ac.id/files/2015/02/Ross_8th_ed_English.pdf).

2. [Calculus 1-4](): Notes associated with Cape Cod Community College's calculus classes, taught by the great Minxie Zhang. Notes still need to be translated over to digital.

3. [Linear Algebra](): Notes associated with WPI's Linear Algebra class, taught by Simone Cassani. Notes still need to be translated over to digital.

4. [Discrete Mathematics](): Notes associated with WPI's Discrete Math class, taught by William C. Sanguinet. Notes still need to be translated over to digital.

5. [Differential Equations](): Notes associated with WPI's Differential Equations class, taught by Konstantin Lurie. Notes still need to be translated over to digital.

6. [Real Analysis](): I have yet to take this class.


### Machine Learning

1. [Statistical Learning](): Notes associated with the various resources I have used to learn machine learning. Notes still need to be translated over to digital.

2. [CS-534](): Notes associated with WPI's CS-534 Artificial Intelligence class {% include sidenote.html id="note-pgm" note="I realize that artificial intelligence isnt a facet of machine learning. Its just where im deciding to put these notes." %}, taught by Carolina Ruiz. Notes still need to be translated over to digital.


### Deep Learning

1. [CS-541](notes/Deep-Learning/CS-541/): All my notes from WPI's CS-541 Deep Learning, taught by Professor Whitehill. Notes still need to be translated over to digital.
2. [PRML](notes/Deep-Learning/bishops/Outline/bishops_outline.md): All my notes from reading the textbook [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](http://users.isr.ist.utl.pt/~wurmd/Livros/school/Bishop%20-%20Pattern%20Recognition%20And%20Machine%20Learning%20-%20Springer%20%202006.pdf). Notes still need to be translated over to digital.
3. [CS231n](): All my notes from Stanford's [CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition's](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) class. Notes still need to be translated over to digital.



## Resources

1. [Resources For Everything](notes/resources/): This is quite literally every resource I have used to date that I think is worth using, given the topic. 
2. [Paper Wish List](notes\Papers\Wish_list): Here is my wish list of papers I hope to read in the future.
