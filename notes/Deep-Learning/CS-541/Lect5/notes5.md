## Logistic Regression

### Regression vs. Classification

Recall the two main supervised learning cases

* Regression: predict any real number
* Classification: choose from a finite set (e.g., {0, 1}).

So far, we have talked only about the first case.

### Binary Classification

The simplest classification problem consists of just 2 classes (binary classification), i.e., $y \; \epsilon \{ 0, 1\}$. 

One of the simplest and most common classification techniques is logistic regression.
