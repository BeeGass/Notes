## Curriculum:

**First, second and third pass** 

As you go through just get enough knowledge to finish the projects. There is a second pass where we will go back through, starting from the beginning, to get a more in depth understanding of the material. 

### First Pass: 

1. [fast.ai, part 1](https://course.fast.ai/)

2. [fast.ai, part 2](https://course19.fast.ai/part2)  

   **Additionally supplement material by reading chapters from the following**

   1. [Neural Networks and Deep Learning Textbook](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html)
   2. [Dive Into Deep Learning Textbook](https://d2l.ai/)



### Second Pass: 

1. [WPI's Deep Learning Course](https://video.wpi.edu/hapi/v1/ui/permalinks/Mb5g3C7K) *As you go understand the material thoroughly and do the homeworks to completion*
   **Supplement this course with the following:**

   1. [LeCun's NYU Deep Learning Course](https://atcold.github.io/pytorch-Deep-Learning/ )
   2. [Introduction to Deep Learning, by Sebastian Raschka](https://sebastianraschka.com/blog/2021/dl-course.html)

   **Additionally supplement material by reading chapters from the following**

   1.  [Dive Into Deep Learning Textbook](https://d2l.ai/)
   2. [The Deep Learning Book](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)
   3. [Pattern Recognition And Machine Learning](http://users.isr.ist.utl.pt/~wurmd/Livros/school/Bishop - Pattern Recognition And Machine Learning - Springer  2006.pdf)

### Third Pass:

1. Go in depth by reading FULL chapters and doing problems from the following. Additionally, time should be evenly spent also implementing papers of your choice refer to paper wish list for this
   1. [Pattern Recognition And Machine Learning](http://users.isr.ist.utl.pt/~wurmd/Livros/school/Bishop - Pattern Recognition And Machine Learning - Springer  2006.pdf)
   2. ["Probabilistic Machine Learning" - a book series by Kevin Murphy](https://probml.github.io/pml-book/)
