I"é<p><span class="newthought">These notes</span> behave as my one stop shop for all classes I have taken and wish to review. My hope is that this can become somewhat of a database of notes for me (and hopefully others) to review. <label for="note-pgm" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="note-pgm" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">I will often use these sidenotes as a way to define terms, clarify ideas further or whatever else that may be applicable.</span> Please understand that I am writing these notes as im watching lecture so there may be spelling mistakes, lapses in grammar, profanity or simply incorrect material. I hope to revise these as soon as possible.</p>

<p>If you wish to learn more about the content that is learned in each class then I would recommend clicking on the links to various classes where you will be redirected to the table of contents for that applicable class. <label for="mn-construction" class="margin-toggle">âŠ•</label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-construction" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote">The notes are still <strong>under construction</strong>! You will probably find several typos. If you do, please let me know, or submit a pull request with your fixes to the <a href="https://github.com/BeeGass/Notes">GitHub repository</a>.</span></p>
